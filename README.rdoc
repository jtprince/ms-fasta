= {Ms-Fasta}[http://mspire.rubyforge.org/projects/ms-fasta]

An {Mspire}[http://mspire.rubyforge.org] library for working with {FASTA}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasta_format] files.

NOTE: A simple shell around the bio gem's fasta readers has been implemented
and is found in ms-core.  It contains more utilities for reading fasta header
lines, but it is a little slower than this gem.

    gem install ms-core
